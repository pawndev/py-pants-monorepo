        # changes to any file that can affect the build, so may not be practical in larger repos.

        # Note that named_caches and lmdb_store falls back to partial restore keys which
        # may give a useful partial result that will save time over completely clean state,
        # but will cause the cache entry to grow without bound over time.
        # See https://pants.readme.io/docs/using-pants-in-ci for tips on how to periodically clean it up.
        # Alternatively you change gha-cache-key to ignore old caches.
